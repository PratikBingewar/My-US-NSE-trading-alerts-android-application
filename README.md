# Zone Trading Alerts Android App

Iâ€™ve created a system which monitors the stock market and sends alerts when it identifies a moment when stock price is about to start growing (you can read more at http://stocksbuyalerts.com/). The system is based on the theory of so-called supply and demand zones. My software recognizes demand zones, assesses the probability of the price growth, and notifies the subscribers. The target audience for these alerts is day traders (people who actively buy and sell stocks within a day), so it is very important that subscribers receive alerts quickly.
